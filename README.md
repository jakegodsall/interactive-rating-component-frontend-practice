## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I have learned a ton from completing this project. 
This is the first Frontend Mentor project I have worked on where I have used JavaScript. The most notable points here are:

- How to use event listeners to select one from many elements via clicking (and remove previous selection)
- How to use `display:none` to hide and show different components using event listeners.


### Continued development

I shall continue to work on similar projects, until the intersection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript becomes more intuitive to me. Also, I will learn how to use `display:grid` for the next project I work on.
